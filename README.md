# Eugene
A chatterbot, originally for the TI-84+ SE, which was ported to Android for further development. World record holder for dumbest chatterbot (unofficially). No relation to Goostman.

This project was started when the author was bored in geometry class. I turned to my neighbor, Brianna, and asked for a name, with which she replied, "Eugene", so naming the project.

Development proceeded, mostly in the aforementioned geometry class, until I ran out of ideas with which to proceed. The original program, sadly, is lost.

However, when I started toying with application development, I had the idea to port an existing application to Android. So, Eugene for Android was born, as my first 'real', functionally useful application.

As such, the design is counterproductive (RelativeLayout vs LinearLayout), done entirely in Java (almost), and generally messy enough that I don't really want to mess with most of it.
